# Scenario 01 - Single Sign On between multiple heterogeneous identity federation protocols

## SOLUTION DESCRIPTION

### Problem:

- The business users need to access multiple service providers supporting multiple heterogeneous identity federation protocols.

- Some service providers are on-premise while others are in the cloud. For example Google Apps (SAML 2.0), Salesforce (SAML 2.0), Office 365 (WS-Federation) are cloud based while JIRA, Drupal, Redmine are on-premise service providers.

- A user logs into any of the service providers should be automatically logged into the rest.

### Scenario:

- Deploy WSO2 Identity Server over the enterprise user store.

- Represent each service provider in the WSO2 Identity Server and configure the corresponding inbound authenticators (SAML, OpenID, OIDC, WS-Federation).

- In each service provider, configure WSO2 Identity Server as a trusted identity provider. For example in Google Apps, add WSO2 Identity Server as a trusted identity provider.

Products: WSO2 Identity Server 5.0.0+
